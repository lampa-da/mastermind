**Mastermind Game**

The Mastermind game starts with the codemaker/computer turn. It creates a hidden row of pegs. It could be any color of 6 and any color can repeat. The codemaker has the â€œsecret code area" hidden from the user.
The codebreaker/the player tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color. The player has 10 attempts. 
Once the codemaker has created the secret code, the codebreaker/player places any combination of 4 colored pegs. Once placed, the computer provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs.
It will use white and black pegs. The white pegs indicate a correct color but wrong position; the black pegs indicate pegs in a correct position and with the correct color. If neither is true, then no pegs are going to be placed. 
Play continues until the code is discovered and a player is won, or there are no remaining guesses, and the player is lost. 


**The next steps to improving my project are going to be**
1. Create "check" and "clear" buttons to be able to change the player's choice.
2. Add sounds for the pegs. When the player is clicking, they will be able to hear the sound. 
3. Create a timer to  track the best score.
4. Create score storage, where the program will collect ten names with the best scores. The game will show the table of the best ten players after each game, and if the player has a better score, they will be adding their nickname to the table.
